### Hash table

An open-addressed, double-hashed hash table in C.

* `search(a, k)`: return the value `v` associated with key `k` from the associative array `a`, or `NULL` if the key does not exist.
* `insert(a, k, v)`: store the pair `k:v` in the associative array `a`.
* `delete(a, k)`: delete the `k:v` pair associated with `k`, or do nothing if `k` does not exist.
